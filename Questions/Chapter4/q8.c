// Write a program to process weekly employee time cards for all employees of 
// an organization. Each employee will have three data items: an identification 
// number, the hourly wage rate, and the number of hours worked during a given 
// week. Each employee is to be paid time and a half for all hours worked over 
// 40. A tax amount of 3.625% of gross salary will be deducted. The program output should show the employeeâ€™s number and net pay. Display the total payroll 
// and the average amount paid at the end of the run.
